            <div class="title">About Me</div>
            <div class="description">My interesting in programming was first sparked doing VBA programming in university - the initial motivation for me to rely on code was to be able to process large datasets quickly and automate spreadsheet tasks I found myself to be doing repeatedly. However, I was quickly drawn to the process of creating and implementing code to handle evermore complex tasks - of which solving these problems was the real reward.
                <br><br>
                I've since expanded my knowledge of coding beyond VBA, with experience now in Python, SQL, Javascript and Octave. I've built this website to showcase some of the projects I'd completely in my spare time to further my abilities in programming - I'm particularly fond of the Simple Twitter that I've built (took a real spark of inspiration to draw up that logo! It's meant to be tongue-in-cheek, of course).
                <br><br>
                With how software/tech is increasingly becoming the backbone of operations across all industries, I'm keen to get involved in this evolution of the modern economy.
