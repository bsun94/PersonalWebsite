            <div class="title">About Me</div>
            <div class="description">My interest in programming was first sparked in university with VBA - the initial motivation for me to code was to be able to process large datasets quickly and to automate spreadsheet tasks I found myself to be doing repeatedly. However, I was quickly drawn to the process of creating tools to handle more and more complex tasks - solving these problems was a real treat.
                <br><br>
                I've since expanded my programming capabilities beyond VBA, with experience now in Python, SQL, Javascript, HTML/CSS and Octave. I've built this website to showcase some of the projects I'd completed in my spare time to further my skills in programming - I'm particularly fond of the <a href="supporting_htmls/portfolio-simpletwitter.html" class="description a">Simple Twitter</a> that I built (took a real spark of inspiration to draw up that logo! It's meant to be tongue-in-cheek, of course, <i>and to avoid copyright</i>).
                <br><br>
                With how software/tech is increasingly becoming the backbone of operations across all industries, I'm keen to take part in this evolution of the modern economy.
