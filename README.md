# Personal Portfolio Website
##### Website showcasing one's personal projects/work completed.
______________________

Website is built using HTML/CSS/vanillaJS. Do make sure you have JS functionalities such as IntersectionObserver and addEventListener available (in the off chance that your JS installation goes awry).

I've currently populated the website with my own content/projects, but anyone can simply change up the images, text and hyperlinks to build their own site based on the same structure, webpage interactions and animations.
