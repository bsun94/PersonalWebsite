                As we lived through more and more of the pandemic, I noticed that cases and deaths were mostly concentrated in a few countries (I'd kept track of online COVID counts). That sparked the idea to build a tracker that can display a choropleth map of COVID cases and deaths around the world. <i>The interactive map of COVID cases (as of October 3, 2020) above shows an example of the visualizations this tool can generate.</i> Pointers are assigned to the top 10 countries - click on them to see their respective counts.
                <br><br>
                In building the tool, finding an online data source was the most important first step. Thankfully, the folks over at <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus" target="_owid">Our World in Data (OWID)</a> offer data sourced from the <i>European Centre for Disease Control</i> for free use.
                <br><br>
                The program I wrote would first take user input as to whether they want to see cases or deaths data visualized, and their desired date. Based on these inputs, the tool would then pull the relevant data from the OWID data source above and clean it up (e.g. for inconsistencies in country name spellings). It then builds the choropleth maps using the folium library, and resynthesizes pieces of the COVID data for presentation on the map. With selenium, it finally outputs an interactive map on the user's screen, such as the one above and the one below.
                <br><br>
                <i>The map below, also generated by the tool, showcases the total number of COVID deaths in the world as of October 3, 2020. Please click on the image to load the interactive map.</i>
