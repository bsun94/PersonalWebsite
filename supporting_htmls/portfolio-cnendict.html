                While using a French dictionary to look up some words I didn't know in a French newspaper article (in <i>Le Monde</i>, France's national newspaper), I had the sudden idea for a full-stack project: to build a Chinese-English dictionary. I'd previously found a decent online Chinese dictionary to use, but it was only Chinese-Chinese (i.e. Chinese definitions for Chinese words/characters), and not Chinese-English. I decided to build the latter myself, and to learn React in the process. I've embedded the final product above, but you can also <a href="https://master.d3bpdh4bmdckfp.amplifyapp.com/" target="_cnendict">click here</a> to go to my dictionary web app's page. <b>APP FEATURES:</b> <i>dictionary lookup, tracker of the most recent session lookups, "Entry of the Day" based on a randomly-selected dictionary entry and a multiple-choice quiz on Chinese words.</i>
                <br><br>
                The first step was to find data on Chinese characters and their English definitions - I had, admittedly, not spent all the free time in my life translating each and every single Chinese character. Conveniently, a person by the name of Paul Denisowski had been collecting <a href="https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?page=cc-cedict" target="_mdbg">such data</a> since 1997 and has published it online. Inconveniently, he'd stored all his translations in a .u8 file - opening this file with Text Editor takes a good couple of minutes. Paul included on the site's page work done by somebody by the name of Franki Allegra to parse the .u8 file; however, Franki's script (whether by design or not) ignores all definitions after the first for every character, which wasn't ideal, and only outputs the data to JSON. I wrote my own Python script, using a bit of Franki's parser, which was able to parse every single definition for each character, and subsequently built a .db file based on the end, parsed data.
                <br><br>
                The frontend of the dictionary was built in React. After downloading/installing Node.js, I kicked off an installation of a React app instance, and went with building. I modularized different parts of my web app's webpage, using React functional components for the more static parts like the main header (that says "Chinese-English dictionary") and acknowledgements section. I used class components for more complex pieces that e.g. needed to make API calls to my server (below) to look up Chinese characters, get the "Entry of the Day" (upon initial page load) or to let the user play the word quiz. The word quiz component, in particular, is able to conditionally render certain page elements based on if the user's selected choice is right/wrong, and is also able to keep track of how many answers *in a row* the user was able to get right on the first try.
                <br><br>
                As for the backend, I used Python's Flask module to build an API server, which takes in a Chinese character requested, and is capable of looking up that character in the dictionary database. It is also able to use the current date as a random seed to select an entry as the "Entry of the Day" and return it to the React app, as well as pick out a number of random dictionary entries (which do not overlap) and return them to the React app as choices for the word quiz game.
                <br><br>
                Everything at this point was working locally; the final step was to host it all online. For the React components, I used AWS's Amplify, which is actually based on Git repos - I set up a repo for this project, and in the build settings yaml of my AWS Amplify instance, specified how to navigate to my React app's directory, and then build up and deployed the app. For my Python Flask API server, I used AWS Elastic Beanstalk. AWS EB was a bit more involved, as you had to initialize an EB repo on your local machine to then upload to EB for the first build (as per their documentation), and the AWS EB shell function took a while to install. You also had to zip all your server-related files to upload to AWS EB every time you wanted to update the instance.
                <br><br>
                At this point, I was running into problems with HTTP. Essentially, AWS Amplify hosted my React page on HTTPS, while EB hosted my server on HTTP. Modern browsers don't like such so-called "mixed content", so I had to get my EB to be hosted on HTTPS. An SSL certificate is required to host with HTTPS, and to get one on Amazon, you pretty much had to get a domain name (so Jeff Bezos made an extra $12 off of me this year) with AWS Route 53 and route that domain name to your EB instance, certify the domain with Amazon Certificate Manager, and establish a new listener in your EB instance which uses HTTPS using your new SSL certificate approved by Amazon CM. Surprisingly (or not), it took me longer to get everything done on Amazon than to code my actual React app frontend.
