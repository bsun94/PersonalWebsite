                I decided to build out a personal website showcasing some of the projects that I'd completed in my personal time, and to use it as a good opportunity to flesh out my HTML/CSS and JavaScript skills. I had previously taken a university course in HTML, so I was already familiar with the language - CSS and JavaScript were new to me. After a few hours of online reading and YouTube tutorials, I felt like I had enough of an understanding of all languages involved to get building.
                <br><br>
                I decided on a website structure where the Main page would contain a "slideshow" of sorts (the effects I coded up are what really make it so) of intro pages linking to various portfolio pages providing more information on each project that I had done. I try on each page to give a walkthrough of how I had built each project, some technical details as necessary, and to provide a link in the end to the source code on my <a href="https://github.com/bsun94" target="github">Github.</a>
                <br><br>
                For this website, if you look at the HTML, I've tried to section off each of my webpages into divs with distinct classes. Classes meant to be attached to parent divs (or outer divs in general) are given more general attributes in the CSS file, whereas inner div classes are given just those attributes specific to those individual elements I want to see on the webpage. (Following how CSS is meant to work). With JavaScript, I've managed to implement lightboxes, an on-load animation for images on my portfolio pages, as well as the slideshow effect for the Main page. I decided to do it all in vanilla JavaScript just to get well-versed with the fundamentals - for larger project builds, I'd probably move on to a framework like React.
